## Usage

"Cards of Opportunity" is a fun and quick way to settle friendly wagers or make decisions with a bit of competitive excitement. Here's how to use it:

1. **Set a Wager**: Before starting, agree on a friendly task or decision to wager on with your opponent, like who takes out the trash.

2. **Play the Game**: Each player draws a card, and the one with the higher card value wins the round. The first to win 2 out of 3 rounds wins the game.

3. **Settle the Wager**: The loser completes the agreed-upon task or decision, adding a playful twist to everyday choices.

This app showcases smooth integrations with SwiftUI, Swift Data, REST API, and animations. It's a great example of how a simple concept can be turned into an engaging mobile experience.
